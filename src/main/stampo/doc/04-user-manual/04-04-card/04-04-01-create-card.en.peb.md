### Create a Card

There are two ways to create a card.

The first one, is by using the <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> shortcut in the column footer.

Enter the card name, click **Add**, and a new card will appear at the top of the column, if the card has been created via the context menu, or at the bottom, if the quick link in the footer has been used.
