#### Link to a single comment

The <i class="fa fa-link"></i> can be used to retrieve the link to a single comment.

#### Update a comment

Once the comment is updated, the previous version isn't lost. The application keeps track of how many times a comment has been updated, and who made those updates.

Once a comment is deleted, a particular type of notification will appear in the lower left corner of the application. Clicking undo will result in the comment being restored.
