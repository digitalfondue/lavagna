### Change user settings

This section enables the user to manage his display name, e-mail address, e-mail notifications and calendar feeds.
The "Clear All Tokens" button resets all the user's logins that use the "Remember me" option, so it'll be necessary to re-enter the credentials at the next visit.

By default the calendar feed is enabled but it can be disabled from this panel. The feed is a standard ICS document and the URL can be added as a subscription to any client (Gmail, Outlook, Mac OS X Calendar, ...).
Every card assigned or watched by the user with a due date or custom date label will be shown in the feed:

Every event will contain the card's name, status, description, creator and URL.
